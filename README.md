# Git Gud
A place to practice your GitHub with R/RStudio skills without the fear of breaking something!  

*** 

This repository is designed for newcomers to both R/RStudio and GitHub, and consists of two primary folders to work from:  

**Typos** 
_Typos_ consists of a multitude of text files that have typos in them. While it might be tempting to go through and fix ALL THE TYPOS!, please be considerate and save some for other learners.

**And then**
_And then_ is a take on the classic improv game, "[Yes, and](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...)." There are multiple RMarkdown files in this repository, all starting with a single sentence prompt followed by "and then..." Your responsibility is to build on the story by adding no more than five sentences and/or one code chunk (it's up to you whether or not it takes a data-driven turn!), and then finishing your contribution with "and then..."

**How to GitHub with R/RStudio**
The aim of this project is not to _teach_ you GitHub, but rather provide a space for you to practice applying what you're learning about GitHub with R/RStudio to a public repository without worrying about breaking something or being judged for not *quite* knowing what you're doing.  

We strongly recommend the [Happy Git With R](http://happygitwithr.com/) tutorial by [Jenny Bryan](https://twitter.com/JennyBryan) for learning how to use GitHub from the RStudio interface.  

Sections 23 and 24 of Happy Git With R will walk you through the basics of contributing to a repo. You can apply these skills to working in the "Git Gud" repository!

* contributing new beginner-friendly projects beyond **typos** and **and then**
